###[A] Another user adding a "Me too!"
If you have a NEW question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button. If you have sufficient reputation, [you may upvote](//$SITEURL$/privileges/vote-up) the question. Alternatively, "star" it as a favorite and you will be notified of any new answers.

###[C] Too localized
This question appears to be off-topic because it is too localized.

###[EQ] Improper tagging
The tags you were using are not appropriate for this question. Please review [What are tags, and how should I use them?](//$SITEURL$/help/tagging)

###[Q] Low-Quality Posts by New User
It's difficult to tell what is being asked here, and this question cannot be reasonably answered in its current form. Please provide the context, and/or post code samples of what you have done (i.e.: [What have you tried?](http://whathaveyoutried.com))

###Javascript: Don't just fiddle
Please include a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (MCVE)](https://$SITEURL$/help/mcve) that demonstrates your problem in your post and **don't just include

###[A]Asking why this is not working on an Answer
This does not provide an answer to the question. You can [search for similar questions](https://$SITEURL$/search), or refer to the related and linked questions on the right-hand side of the page to find an answer. If you have a related but different question, [ask a new question](https://$SITEURL$/questions/ask), and include a link to this one to help provide context. See: [Ask questions, get answers, no distractions](https://$SITEURL$/tour)

###[Q] Homework
Unfortunately your question only contains requirements: it is not showing any efforts from your side to solve this problem yourself. Please add your attempts to this question, as this community is about *helping* you to solve your problem yourself, not about *solving* it *for* you. Beyond that: please turn to the [help] to learn how/what to ask here. Thanks!

###[Q] Quality
Unfortunately, you input lacks in quality regarding its **form**. Such input is very likely to be downvoted and closed. Thus: please use the [edit] link to improve your question. Also note that  *preview* window (together with the help explaining formatting) to improve the quality of your posting. Please note: it is an absolute no-go to use screen shots for code/error messages. Everything that is text should be represented as (formatted/indented) text! Thanks!

###[Q] MCVE
Questions seeking debugging help ("why isn't this code working?") must include the desired behavior, a specific problem or error and the shortest code necessary to reproduce it in the question itself. Questions without a clear problem statement are not useful to other readers. See: How to create a [mcve]. Use the [edit] link to improve your *question* - do not add more information via comments. Thanks!

###[Q] Asking for help
Unfortunately your question boils down to "somebody please help me with this". But we do not regard such requests as questions in the scope of this site. Please read [this](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/284236/why-is-can-someone-help-me-not-an-actual-question) carefully to understand why that is. Then consider to either delete this question and putting up a new, more precise question within the scope of this community. Alternatively, you could [edit], rework and improve this question. Thanks!

###[Q] Rec
Questions asking us to recommend or find a book, tool, software library, tutorial or other off-site resource are off-topic for $SITENAME$ as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it, or consider deleting *this* question please! Thanks!

###[A] Answers just to say Thanks!
Please don't add "thanks" as answers. Invest some time in the site and you will gain sufficient [privileges](//$SITEURL$/privileges) to upvote answers you like, which is the $SITENAME$ way of saying thank you. Thanks!

###[A] Nothing but a URL (and isn't spam)
Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference. See [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/94027/285661) for instructions how to write *better* "link-based" answers. Thanks!

###[A] Should be comment
This is really a comment, not an answer. With a bit more rep, [you will be able to post comments](//$SITEURL$/privileges/comment). Thanks!

###[A] Should be question
If you have another question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button. Please do so now, and delete this answer. Thanks!
